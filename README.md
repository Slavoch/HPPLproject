# HPPLproject
In order to launch this project, you first have to launch receiver.py , then launch all blocks of sender.ipynb. 
Then you should click on the link provided in results window, this is the link to the server with the app. Input data
could be changed in online mode via relaunching the sender.ipynb with renewed data. The sender.ipynb generates a json file
as an example of capabilities of this app.

To clarify, xy_data.json is a set of random variables used to demonstrate the abilities of the dash app. 
The sender.ipynb is written in a way so that you can import any json files, pandas dataframes, cvs files from either
your PC or the internet.
